# R-codes-for-dual-inverse-regression
The R codes are specified for the scenario of causal inference with binary treatments. They can be easily adjusted for the general cases.
The R codes include three main functions:
1. dirm: the function that runs the dual inverse regression methods.
2. ladle.dirm: the function that determines the dimension of the reduced predictor.
3. ladle.glb: the function that determines whether the unique global subspace exists.
Please see the header of each R function for more details.
